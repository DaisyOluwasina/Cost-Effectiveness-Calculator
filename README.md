# 💊 Cost-Effectiveness Calculator

**Author**: Daisy Oluwasina  
**Project Type**: R Shiny Web Application  
**Focus**: Health Economics – Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)

## 🚀 Overview

This interactive R Shiny app demonstrates a fundamental health economics concept: **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)**. It allows users to compare two health interventions – a **standard treatment** and a **new treatment** – based on their **costs** and **QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years)**.

The app calculates the **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** and plots both treatments on a **Cost-Effectiveness Plane**.

> 🎯 This app was built to showcase my applied skills in health economics, data visualization, and economic evaluation using R.
